This project demonstrates how to implement basic authentication and authorization in a Spring Boot application using Spring Security with in-memory user details. It provides a simple yet powerful example of securing REST endpoints while allowing open access to specific URLs.This setup helps beginners understand how Spring Security handles user authentication, request authorization, and login mechanisms — forming the foundation for more advanced configurations like database-backed users or JWT-based authentication.
